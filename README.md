# Cult.Fit Clone

CultFit is a health and fitness company offering digital and offline experiences across fitness, nutrition, and mental well-being. With the aim to make fitness fun and easy, CultFit gives workouts a whole new meaning with a range of trainer-led, online group workout classes.

In this project we have tried to make a look alike clone of CultFit. With our efforts and the technology stack, that we have learned so far in the masai school, we were able to clone the front end with high precision and quality. This Project is build as part of Masai School Curriculum project and completed in duration of 6 days.
